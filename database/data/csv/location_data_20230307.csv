Our geoscientists have determined that it is a volcano that erupted about 9,000 years ago and went extinct. In other words, it is not only the most recently extinct volcano among the extinct volcanoes of our country, but it is also a ""new"" mountain that is still raging. Mount Khorgo is 2240 meters above sea level, and the hot molten magma that erupted from Mount Khorgo has flowed hundreds of kilometers along the valleys of Suman and Chuluut Rivers. Scientists have assumed that the magma that flowed through the 10-20 kilometer wide valley along this route may have frozen into a 40-50 meter thick layer of natural stone. It is also said that Mount Khorgo erupted twice. The mouth of the mountain crater has a circular shape with a diameter of 300-400 meters, a slope of about 50 degrees, and a depth of about 100 meters. It is difficult to walk because there are large rocks like chairs and tables inside the crater. You can enter the crater only from the right side, very carefully. About six kilometers south of Khorgo Mountain, on the right bank of the Suman River, and about 3 kilometers southwest of the center of Tariat Sum, there is an interesting stone house. While boiling and flowing, the foam of hot molten magma cracked and formed into the ""figures"" and ""vvds"" of the 170-centimeter-tall stone house. Such a stone house is not found in any of our other extinct volcanoes. Another miracle of Khorg is the abundance of nuts and other fruits of the low-lying cedar trees that grow in the gaps between the limestone surfaces. There are many caves and tunnels in the natural stone. About 20 kilometers from Mount Khorgo, there are three extinct volcanoes: Bosgyn, Khyaryn, and Sugy craters.

Kharkhorum was an important political, economic, cultural, administrative and international center of Mongolia at that time. The city has gates on four sides protected by 2-story mud walls. At the 4 entrances to the city, trade was conducted. Horses were traded near the north gate, grains were traded near the east gate, cattle and carts were near the front gate, and sheep and goats were traded near the west gate. When Kublai Khan established the Yuan state in 1271 and transferred the new capital of Mongolia to Beijing, the city's reputation and importance decreased, but the city of Harkhorum gradually collapsed after more than 100 years due to repeated attacks by the Ming army in 1379-1380.

The pictures of animals on the rocks of Ishgen Tolg are not only here and there, but also in any direction. The color of the engraving has faded with age and is almost indistinguishable from the color of the rock, and you can tell that it was carved and painted by hand. This indicates that it is very ancient. Compared to other petroglyphs, most paintings are depicted on the leeward side, while the Ishgen Head petroglyphs are painted on the ground on the upwind side, which is constantly being blown by the wind. It is obvious that he tried to highlight the features of his carved animals, and the ibex horn is depicted in a beautiful bow shape without reaching the back, while the horn of the antelope is drawn in a semi-circular shape with the tip folded over. The general shape of the animal's body is flattened and the head is hollowed out. It means that it is a method of painting at that time. Also, the method of leaving the abdomen and legs of animals incomplete is also observed.

It is the birthplace of Genghis Khan, and it is a mountain revered by Mongolians, with a legend that it contains his tomb. Mongolians used to call the Khairkhan ""Khadun Khairkhan"", but later, due to the influence of Buddhism, the name Burhan was added to ""Burhan Khaldun"", and it is not disputed that Mongolians did not use the word ""God"" before the influence of Buddhism. Burhan Khaldun mountain is covered with dense trees on its back, with sparse trees only at the top and taiga vegetation. There are three mounds in Burhan Khaldun mountain, namely upper, middle and lower. The lower mound is at the foot of the mountain, and the middle mound is in the middle of the mountain. The top of the mountain has a large open area. In the middle of the square is an overturned trough-like platform that looks almost man-made. Taller than a ten-story building, the top of this mountain is the top pile. It takes about two hours to reach from the small mound to the middle mound on a good horse. In the middle of the mound, there is a large bronze pot with a diameter of about a meter. There is a beautiful clear lake in an oval canyon on the slope, going down from the big mound at the top of the mountain. Bazargur, a researcher at the Institute of Geography of MAS, put forward a new idea, and he said, ""When the Thais were living in the area called Temujin Burgi Beach, the Thais came and fled to Munkhjargalan Mountain, which is 24 kilometers from Temujin Burgi Beach. He lived in this mountain for many years. ""That's why this mountain should be the real state sacred mountain of Burhan Khaldun."" At the beginning of the long history, Han Khentii Mountain was called Burhan Khaldun. Also, there are 13 places named Burhan Khaldun in Khenti mountain range. Among them, the highest peak is called Burhan Khaldun. But this is not a sacred mountain of the state. But it is said that Genghis Khan used to worship Munkhjargalan when he went on a journey. Burhan Khaldun is a place where the heart of Mongolian people is deeply immersed in piety. In 1818, the ritual was officially performed. In 1992, an area of 12,000 km² was designated as a special protected area of Khan Khent and received state protection. In 1995, by the decree of the president, Mount Burhan Khaldun was made a sacred mountain of the state.

In 1900, an epidemic broke out and half of the monks of the monastery were affected. In 1930, the communist regime began to persecute the monks, and in 1937, the monastery was destroyed. Since then, it has been forbidden to set foot in that direction for almost 60 years. In 1990, a few monks returned and started collecting books, and the local blacksmiths joined together to build a small wooden shrine. But now the restoration work has started.

Headed graves vary in size. The largest one is located at the north-eastern edge of the cemetery, its main structure measures 40x40 m and the nave is about 60 m long. The small grave with a pile is about 5x5 m in size and has a pile up to 5 m long. Most of the graves in the cemetery are about 10-15 m, 20-25 m. The memorial site was first discovered in 1974 by H. Perle, and in 1991, as part of the Mongolian-Japanese joint ""Three Rivers"" project, a background image and a description of some graves were first published. Between 2006 and 2011, the field analysis department of the joint Mongolian-Korean project ""Mon-Sol"" updated the background map and excavated 3 noble tombs and 13 small and satellite tombs located in the southwestern part of the cemetery. Duurlig pine graves have relatively rich finds. Many kinds of artifacts were found, such as bronze bowls, tsars, teapots, mirrors, tea-painted bowls, vintage necklaces, jade articles, iron dinner spoons, filters, horse and cattle equipment, and the remains of chariots.

In the Battle of the Hundred Trees, Galdanboshigt Khan of the Eastern Arm (Near Mongolia) inflicted heavy losses on Manji, but in an unbalanced battle, he escaped from the siege and gathered his remaining forces near Turtle Rock. Fearing that the enemies would chase after him, he prepared to flee to the west, and when the camel he was carrying went up to the top of the Turtle Rock and left the money in the canyon, the queen who had been given by Manju could not take refuge in her gold and silver. Since then, the Frog Rock has been called ""Silver Cliffs and Silver Rocks"" in honor of keeping the money of the Great King.

When King Galdanboshigt went to the west and crossed the mountain north of Melkhi Khad, his helmet glistened in the sun and looked magical, so that pass was called Shining.

He got on the top of the mountain and got very angry, got down from his horse and drew his sword, and the princes of the Khalkhs and the heirs conspired with a foreign enemy who would not fight together for Mongolia, and fell on the ground saying that they had betrayed their country. On the top of the mountain there will be a flat land, and since then, the local people have called it ""Devherge"". The people of Mongolia connect their heroic patriotic sons with the soil of their country and pass on their glory from generation to generation. It has been a patriotic slogan to cultivate the spirit of patriotism and to fight for our land and independence. The will of Galdan Khan, who said, ""Even if God asks for the land of the nobles, do not give it"" has not lost its importance even today. It is the noble duty of the youth to cherish their precious independence, which was earned by the warm blood of generations of patriots. It is said that he tried many times to get the money left by the great king and failed. In winter, after killing a cow, the wet thigh was tied with a rope and placed on the money at the bottom of the canyon. It is said that the great king's money is still kept, and every attempt to get it was unsuccessful. It is said that the queen who slept forever guarding the silver and gold treasures of her great king, continues to adorn the ""Little Mountain"" and the beautiful nature of Mongolia.
